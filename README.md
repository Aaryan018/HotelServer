# HotelServer
This program follows certain protocols regarding the booking of a hotel. In this protocol, the server always responds with a single String. When a client connects, the server should send a welcome message to the client. The client's first request should always be to set the user, so that the server knows who is making reservation. A client can reserve, cancel, check availability, set new user or quit.
